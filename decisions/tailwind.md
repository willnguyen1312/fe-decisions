# Use Tailwind CSS

Date: 2023-06-19

Status: Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on a CSS framework to use for styling our frontend application. Tailwind CSS has been proposed due to its utility-first approach and ease of use.

## Decision

We will use Tailwind CSS for styling the frontend application.

## Consequences

Utility-first: Classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in our markup.

Rapid iterations: Faster iteration times due to minimal styling code.

Responsiveness: Tailwind features responsive utility classes.

Full customizable: Ability to configure and extend Tailwind via plugins and presets.

Large ecosystem: Many resources and examples available online either from the Tailwind team or the community.

Small bundle size: Since Tailwind is a utility-first framework, it only includes the CSS that is used in the application.
