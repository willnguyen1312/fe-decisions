# TypeScript

## Context

Teams and individuals building modern web applications have many great reasons
to build them with TypeScript.

One of the challenges with TypeScript is getting it configured properly. This is
not an issue with modern UI frameworks now that they all have TypeScript support

Another challenge with TypeScript is handling dependencies that are not written
in TypeScript. This is increasingly becoming less of an issue with more and more
dependencies being written in TypeScript.

## Decision

The use of TypeScript is strongly recommended even for simple projects and those
worked on by single developers.

## Consequences

This also may anger some folks who really don't like TypeScript. For those
folks, feel free to fork the starter.
